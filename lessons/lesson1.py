# a=int(input())
# y=
# a=a*a
# print(a)
# # print(int("5"),type(int("abv"))) Incorrect because "abv" isn't an integer
# print(int("5"),type(int("5")))
# print(str(345665),type(str(345)))
# print(bool(""))
# print(bool("abv"))
# print(bool(345))
# print(bool(int("0")))   #0 is identified as a int and because 0 doesn't have a value it returns as false
# print(bool(""))
# print(bool("0"))    #0 is identified as a string and because string contains a value it returns true but if it doesn't it returns false

# b = (int(input("Enter b:")))
# a = (int(input("Enter a:")))
# z = area_of_triangle(a, b)
# print(int(z))
print(int(float("4.6")))   #Because we said that python will first read float and then we will get 4.6 that has type float then int will convert float into a whole number which is a round down number
