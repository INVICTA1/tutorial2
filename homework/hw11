1)Write a program in which the user enters a string, and at the output we get even characters from the entered string.
For example, at the input we get the string "pydocs", at the output "p,d,c" (0,2,4 â€” indexes).

2)Write a function that returns True if the first and last numbers in the list match. If it does not match, return the value False.

3)Our task is to write a program that counts how many times the substring "Jaba" occurs in this line.
  After you count, print a message about how many times our substring appears in the string.
str = "Jaba is a good programmer. Be like Jaba"
4) Write a program that prints the following lines.(Don't use print(1), print(2,2) and etc.)
1 
2 2 
3 3 3 
4 4 4 4 
5 5 5 5 5
5)Write a program that receives two lists as input. 
  Odd numbers are extracted from the first list, and even numbers from the second.
  We add new items to the new list, and output the result.
6)Write a program that outputs a multiplication table. The expected output is shown below.
  Expected result 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20
3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30
4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40
5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50
6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60
7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70
8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80
9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
